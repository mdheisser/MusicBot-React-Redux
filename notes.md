Need to do:
-- sign up or log in form with spotify
-- see profile: my likes and my inputs
-- when dislike button is hit, new song is rendered
-- add animation background
-- add # scroll and react routes

The code is written in ES6 as much as possible *

create-react-app was used to create your React app *

There are 2 container components *

There are 5 stateless components *

There are 3 routes *

react-router is being used with proper RESTful routing *

Redux and redux-thunk middleware are being used to modify state change and make use of async actions to send data and receive data from the server *

Use of Rails API backend to persist data for the application *

Good understanding of the react/redux state flow *

Good understanding of state and props in React *

Knowledge of async JS with Promises
